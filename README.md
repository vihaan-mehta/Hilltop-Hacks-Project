# Hilltop-Hacks-Project
    Ran on Google Colab with Python
    Use the following link in order to run:

    Before beginning, connect Colab to your GPU from the top right corner. This will allow the code to run smoothly. There will be two boxes which you need to run. Remember to run the first and allow it to finish before running the second. Once you run the first, read the instructions for running the second, which are on the Colab. Understanding these are vital to understanding how the project works.
